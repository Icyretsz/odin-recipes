        <h4>FOR SPAGHETTI AND MEAT SAUCE</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground meat like beef, turkey, chicken or lamb</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup (130 grams) chopped onion</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 cup water, broth or dry red wine</li>
            <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 to 3 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>3 to 4 anchovy fillets, minced with some of their oil or use anchovy paste</li>
            <li>Pinch sugar</li>
            <li>1 leftover rind from a wedge of parmesan</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. 
            As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt,
             and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes.
              As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).</li>
        <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions,
             but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
        <li>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce.
             Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.</li>
        </ol>
